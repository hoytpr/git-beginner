Maintainers have hard times with improperly formatted lesson PRs

It would be nice to have a page explaining the process for making a clean, up-to-date repo.

This also has a little about how GitHub really works just to help beginners.

Click on this link to [Clean Git for maintainers and beginners](https://hoytpr.github.io/git-beginner/blob/gh-pages/Maintaining-for-beginners-narrative1.md).

As we get suggestions, I plan to compile them in a single document so that problems and solutions are easy to see in one place. That document will be the [Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks](https://github.com/hoytpr/git-beginner/blob/gh-pages/Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks.md) document
