Maintainers have hard times with improperly formatted lesson PRs

It would be nice to have a page explaining the process for making a clean, up-to-date repo. There are [other options to this page](./Other-options.md)

**EDIT: GitHub now provides a simple button to update your repo to the latest version of the remote repo.**

Because of this, most of this repo is obsolete. I'll be removing it when I have time to go through and delete all obsolete info, hoping there is still some info that is useful.

This also has a little about how GitHub really works just to help beginners.

Click on this link to [Clean Git for maintainers and beginners](./Maintaining-for-beginners-narrative1.md).

As we get suggestions, I plan to compile them in a single document so that problems and solutions are easy to see in one place. That document will be the [Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks](./Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks.md) document

[Motivations and Disclaimers](./motivations_and_disclaimers.md)
