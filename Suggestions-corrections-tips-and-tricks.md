### This is just a list of items that have been reported that are useful, and we might need to discuss to develop a "real" page where a protocol is described flawlessly.

- **Use of "GitHub Online"**: Just wondering what is meant by this term? Perhaps 'user fork' or 'your fork' of a SWC repo might be clearer?
- **Meaning of 'upstream' and 'origin' is reversed**: These notes indicate that the user's fork of a SWC repo is called 'upstream'. This is the opposite to the normal naming convention, where SWC would be referred to as the upstream repo (changes flow downstream to the user fork ('origin')).
- **Using gh-pages:**  Apparently gh-pages may not be used in some new manifestations of the lessons. the "master" branch will be used instead
