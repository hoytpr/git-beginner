**Motivations**

- This small example is not intended to be anything close to a definitive model for how to use GitHub, 
or a consensus pedagogy for how Maintainers use GitHub. This was motivated by my own failures and frustrations. There are
myriad rules and conventions that surround the proper use of GitHub but they are often buried in long and
well-intentioned instructions or tutorials filled with the jargon we all use based on our unique and 
specialized education. 
- Entering into, or even asymptoting toward, a new discipline can be a wonderful part of a lifelong learning process.
But we all have different personal experiences while learning GitHub, varying from agonizing effort to simplistic boredom.
- Considering everyones busy schedule, the hope is to provide context and guidance that improve 
our collective experiences and simplify common processes.
- Imposter syndrome is real, and one way to mitigate its effect is to change the balance of what’s known and what’s unknown.

**Disclaimers**

- The information contained in this exercise as written is probably WRONG and will remain wrong until it gets fixed.
- I have very little experience with GitHub and do not wish to imply in any way, whatsoever, that I have gained sufficient
expertise to lead a discussion on the topic. More than anything, this is a cry for help.
