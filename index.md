# GIT for Beginners

Maintainers have hard times with improperly formatted lesson PRs

These pages contain information about the process for making a clean, up-to-date repo.

This also has a little about how GitHub really works just to help beginners.

Protocols: 
1. [Clean Git for maintainers and beginners]({{ site.baseurl }}/Maintaining-for-beginners-narrative1).

2. [Beginner-beginner maintainer's detailed]({{ site.baseurl }}/One-detailed-protocol-for-beginner-maintainers) (updated!).

3. [Beginner but not maintainer detailed]({{ site.baseurl }}/One-detailed-protocol-for-beginners) (updated)

As we get suggestions, we can compile them in a single document so that problems and solutions are easy to see in one place. That document will be the [Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks]({{ site.baseurl }}/Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks) document.

[Motivations and Disclaimers]({{ site.baseurl }}/motivations_and_disclaimers)
