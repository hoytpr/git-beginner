# GIT for Beginners

Maintainers have hard times with improperly formatted lesson PRs

These pages contain information about the process for making a clean, up-to-date repo.

This also has a little about how GitHub really works just to help beginners.

Protocols: 
1. [Clean Git for maintainers and beginners](https://hoytpr.github.io/git_beginner/Maintaining-for-beginners-narrative1).

2. [Beginner-beginner maintainer's detailed](https://hoytpr.github.io/git_beginner/One-detailed-protocol-for-beginner-maintainers) (updated!).

3. [Beginner but not maintainer detailed](https://hoytpr.github.io/git_beginner/One-detailed-protocol-for-general-beginners) (updated)

As we get suggestions, we can compile them in a single document so that problems and solutions are easy to see in one place. That document will be the [Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks](https://hoytpr.github.io/git_beginner/Suggestions-corrections-tips-and-tricks) document.
